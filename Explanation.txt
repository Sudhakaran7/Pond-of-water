A pond of water, you are given with two jugs a,b with a liter capacity to each, you are give a target liters of water, so that
you have to say whether you can get exactly target liters of water with the given jugs.

Input description:
First line contains, a,b,target. (1<a,b,target<1000)

Output Description:
True or False

Sample Input:
3 5 4

Sample output:
True

Explanation:
Two jugs are (3,5), the target liter is 4,
so initially we take water in 3 liter jug and fill the 5 liter jug,
next, again we take water in 3 liter jug and fill the 5 liter jug, but we already have 3 liter so we can only fill 2 liter, and empty the 5 liter jug
so we have 1 liter in 3 liter jug and a empty 5 liter jug, now fill that 1 liter to 5 liter jug, 
next, take water in 3 liter jug and fill the 5 liter jug, so already we have 1 liter and now we filled 3 so 1+3=4
so that is True, we can fill the target liter of water with the given jugs.
